 # **Frank-MCP**

<sup>Project Document</sup>

*Based on Project Charter & Technical Design Document*  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Status:** In Development  

---

## **1. Overview**  

### **1.1 Project Summary**  

**Objective:** Develop an automated configuration tool for development environments with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and specialized knowledge base for backend and DevOps professionals.

**Scope:**  

- Installation and configuration of multiple MCP servers
- Creation of structured knowledge base (including Design Docs)
- Integration with VSCode
- Initial support for Ubuntu 22.04.5

**Goals:**  

- Deliver a functional POC in 3 days
- Simplify the MCP environment configuration process
- Provide foundation for future project expansion

### **1.2 Justification**

Manual configuration of MCP servers and knowledge bases is a complex and error-prone process. This tool automates this process, allowing developers to quickly leverage the benefits of LLMs in their workflow, with access to specialized knowledge and internal project documentation.

### **1.3 Project Deliverables**  

| Deliverable | Description | Deadline |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Initial POC | Minimum functional version | 3 days |
| Usage Documentation | Installation and usage guide | 5 days |
| Distribution Package | Installation script for Ubuntu | 7 days |

## **5. Risks and Mitigations**  

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Incompatibility with specific Ubuntu versions | Medium | Test on different versions, document specific requirements |
| Changes in MCP server APIs | High | Implement version checks, modular design for easier updates |
| Docker permission issues | Medium | Clear checks and instructions for group configuration |
| Hardware limitations for local models | Low | Document minimum requirements, prioritize cloud models in POC |
